**Go to work by bike**
Sun shines today after couple of rainny days this week. So I decided to go to office by bike (once a week routinely).

I picked up a new route by heading to south first. After coming to the shore, I turned to east along the sea side road. The journey is really enjoyable with the beautiful view and fresh air. I am thinking that next time I would like to go by inline skating or roller skiing. But I need to practice and improve my skills before the trip so that I can relax and enjoy instead of focusing on safety.
